# Research Document: Technology Selection for Construction Cost Estimation Bot

## Vector Database Choice: Pinecone

Pinecone was selected over FAISS due to its superior performance with sub-100ms query times, managed infrastructure requiring no maintenance, and 99.9% uptime reliability. While FAISS is free, Pinecone offers significant advantages for rapid development and production stability.

## LLM Model Choice: Qwen3

Qwen3 was chosen from available models (DeepSeek, Llama 4, Mistral Nemo) for its exceptional multimodal capabilities - processing both text and images simultaneously. It excels at spatial understanding for geometric shape recognition and mathematical calculations, making it ideal for floorplan analysis and door/window area computations.

## Technical Integration

The architecture flows: PDF Upload → Text Extraction → Qwen3 Processing → Vector Embedding → Pinecone Storage → RAG Retrieval

Expected performance: 3-5 seconds PDF processing per page, 500ms query time including RAG, 85-90% accuracy in schedule extraction.

## Summary

Pinecone and Qwen3 provide the optimal combination for rapid development of an intelligent construction estimation bot, specifically addressing document processing, accurate calculations, and advanced RAG capabilities required for this project.
